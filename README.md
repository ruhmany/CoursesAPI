# RahmanyCourses
RahmanyCourses API is a robust and scalable web service built with a focus on clean architecture and design patterns, providing a comprehensive solution for managing a dynamic online courses platform. Leveraging the principles of 4-layer clean architecture, repository pattern, unit of work, CQRS, and MediatR, this API is designed for flexibility, maintainability, and extensibility.

### Key Features
- Clean Architecture: The project follows a 4-layer clean architecture, separating concerns to enhance modularity and maintainability.

- Repository Pattern: Utilizing the repository pattern ensures a clear separation between data access logic and business logic, promoting a scalable and testable codebase.

- Unit of Work: The unit of work pattern facilitates the management of transactions, providing a cohesive mechanism for coordinating multiple data operations.
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation): Adopting CQRS enables a clear distinction between command (write) and query (read) operations, optimizing the system for specific use cases.

- MediatR Design Patterns: The MediatR library is employed to implement the mediator pattern, simplifying the communication between different components of the application.

- AutoMapper: AutoMapper is utilized for seamless object-to-object mapping, streamlining data transformations and reducing boilerplate code.
